_We did it! You found the exit! Remember the following line, it's proof that you actually found the key:_

>   _"A closed door is seldomly an invitation"_

_Now you can grab a beverage of your choice and come back to the Winter Social on GatherTown, or you can explore the escape room to see if you can find any of the easter eggs!_

_If this escape room has gotten you interested in Open Access and Open Science and you want to learn more, check out the [PhDnet Open Science Working Group](https://www.phdnet.mpg.de/phdnet/who/workgroups/open-science-group)! We are always looking for new members :)_
