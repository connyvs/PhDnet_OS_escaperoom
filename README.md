# Virtual Open Science Escape Room

Everything needed to host the virtual Open Science Escape Room, based on a concept by Kristine Sundsb√∏. It starts with two separate paths that converge after just a few steps. Escape Room refers to places outside of the Escape Room twice. Look at the files to see where and where to adapt if necessary.
This version was originally created for the NORMENT Early-Career Researchers Meeting 2020 and the repository is forked from  https://github.com/norment/ecrm20_escaperoom (see there for more information).

It was adapted for the Max Planck PhDnet Winter Social taking place December 18, 2020.
